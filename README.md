This is my first Web software. InventoryTool is intended to manage an IT inventory for a company with multiple offices accross the country.
Software is built using a Flask framework. At the moment, it's a work in progress.

Functionality:
- Authentication using database credentials.
- View inventory using filterable Javascript table.
- Add a new item to inventory.
- Edit existing item information in inventory.
- Assign items for end users.
- View item based history information.
